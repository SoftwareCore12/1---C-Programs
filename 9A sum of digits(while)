// Print the sum of digits of any no.

//to find sum of digits, we need all digits one by one. and then add them in a variable.
// % operator returns remainder when the no is divided. if the no is 1234, after %10 operation, remainder is 4.
//store the operation result in rem variable and add it in sum variable.
// now we need to remove this last digit(4).
// / operator returns quotient when the no is divided. if the no is 1234, after /10 operation, quotient is 123.
//while loop checks the condition again, it is 123, greater than zero. and the loop continues until num becomes 0.

//before loop -   num = 1234   sum = 0   rem = 0
//iteration 1 -  1234%10=4     sum = 4       rem = 4   1234/10=123   num = 123
//iteration 2 -  123%10=3      sum = 4+3=7   rem = 3   123/10=12     num = 12
//itr 3       -  12%10=2       sum = 7+2=9   rem = 2   12/10=1       num = 1
//itr 4       -  1%10=1        sum = 9+1=10  rem = 1   1/10=0        num = 0  [while loop breaks here when num becomes zero]

//             { num%10          sum+rem               num/10 }-->repetition of operations
//write a condition for the loop and place the repition inside the loop...
