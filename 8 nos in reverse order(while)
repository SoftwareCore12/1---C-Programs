// Print nos in reverse order with a difference of 2

//ex - 10 8 6 4 2
//to print nos continuously, a loop is required.
//since 1st no is 10. loop variable should be initialised with 10. i=10
//and the next no is 8. the variable should decrement by 2. i=i-2 => i=10-2 => i=8
//and so on... till 2
//a condition is required to break the loop. since the last no is 2. i should be smaller than 2. while(i>0)
//or we can write conditions like - while(i>=2),while(i>1).

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i=10;  //initialize i with max value 10
    while(i>0)  //loop continues until i is greater than 0
    {
        printf("%d\t",i);  //print no.
        i=i-2;  //decrement i by 2
    }
